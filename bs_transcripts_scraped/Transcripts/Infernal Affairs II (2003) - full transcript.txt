"Avici Hell is also known as Continuous Hell. Uninterrupted time, unlimited space. Boundless suffering for the fallen souls." UNINTERRUPTED TIME TIME I still remember my first arrest. It was December 12, 1980. My partner and I were patrolling Hanoi Road. We were notified that something bad was happening at New World Centre. We rushed over. There was a gang fight in progress. About 15 or so were already down. Lots of blood on the ground. Plus a severed hand, still holding a knife. My partner told me to draw my gun. I was a rookie so I did what he told me. But before I could open the holster, my partner had already collapsed. This kid stabbed his belly with a pipe. Blood gushed out of the sawed-off pipe. I didn't know what to think. I simply put all six of my bullets straight into that kid! I don't remember how many years he got. But when I saw him again two years ago, he was boozing in a club, looking sharp. His buddies were all Kwun's goons. Evil prevails. Only the good die young. Now I can barely recall my partner's face. I regret the six bullets weren't put into that kid's skull. The world shouldn't be like this. It's not the way to be, Sam. How long have you been there? Almost two years now. Do you know why I haven't arrested you? Because I'm handsome! Maybe so. Because I think you're a decent guy. I'd rather you control Tsim Sha Tsui. Forget about it. You couldn't kill the kid, even with six bullets. That makes you a decent guy. That's not the case. I don't want to be one. Kwun gave me everything, even my life. If I turned against him, I'd be beneath contempt, even in your eyes. Right? - I knew you'd say that. - That's a fact! Honor means little to the Ngai family. My master often says, "Revenge knows its time." Who knows how you and I will end up? Time to work! This early? I've got to eat, so do my boys. Take the whole box. - That's okay. Keep it. - Don't worry about it! Just go! Enough. Hey! Want to use the back door? Ain't no rules against schmoozing with cops. The front door's fine. I'm used to it. Prat Avenue! Prat Avenue. HEUNGKONG OPERA CLUB Is Uncle Kwun in? Uncle Kwun! Someone's looking for you! Bye, Mary. They say this American antique's got sweet high, crisp middle and strong bass. Bullshit! One hundred and eighty grand! Who can afford it in Hong Kong? Sit. Only around 10,000 people can afford it. Sam asked you to be a mole in the force. If you don't want to, I can talk to him. You're my boy after all. It's fine. Sure? Positive. Hand me that bag. Mary. You look sulky these days. I thought you'd been dreading it. Hide in Tuen Mun until things quiet down. Stay fit for the Academy's new term. The money I'm giving you, spend it wisely. You like the song? Yeah. It's yours. It won't sound as good on another stereo. Someday, I'll pick out a good one for you. What? Don't like it? Not at all. - Sam gave you that watch, didn't he? - None of your business. Only you and I know about tonight. I don't want Sam to know. Why's that? Women are simple. If a man treats me well, I'll do anything. Now go home. I'm very busy tonight. No big deal. In the gangster world, it's either you or me who gets busted. The boss said I would see blood today. So what? My superiors think highly of me. They kept asking, "Got a Mercedes today, Keung?" I said, "Of course." And here I am! Otherwise, I wouldn't be here with you. I would have Mainland girls in my arms, eating French toast. That's for sure! Hey, got a cigarette? I don't smoke. Let's forget about it. My car's fine. See? She says it's all good. It's fine. Look at you. All dressed up. Don't want any trouble, do you? Look at me. All beaten up by you. Who do you think the judge would believe? Think about it. I bet you guys never go to East Tsim Sha Tsui, huh? Know who I am? I'm Keung! Sam's top dog. Del Piero's boy. I'll kick your ass every time I see you. You can count on that. Hey. How about calling an ambulance, sir? Look at all the blood! Have them bring 500cc Type O blood. It's rare! Shut up! Wait until we're back to the OCTB. - Why do I have to go to the OCTB? - Get him. Hey, sir. I was only stealing a car. - What've I done to deserve the OCTB? - Just shut up! - Don't you know you're just a cadet? - Does that justify an OCTB beating? And you are expected to get an award. Don't let Yip know about this! Happy birthday, Yip! What's there to be happy about? Ten years in the Academy. A rustic hell. You managed to get me out. Your case is already ancient history. Ask the Commissioner to get you out. So what if the Commissioner's Chinese now? Still six more years until the handover. I'll be 48 by then! Might as well train a few good cops here. The world is yours after 1997. Hey. 27149! Cheers! Yan. It's been beeping. Why don't you call back? Girlfriend? - Cheers, sir! - Cheers! Leave me alone! It's none of my business! I don't want to know anything. Go! Hey! Law. What do you want? My father just passed way. He wanted his children to be informed when something bad happened to him. Sorry to have bothered you! Stop watching TV! Eat first, Blackie! I wonder what they have on Uncle Kwun's death. Did you do it? I've got a big mouth. Had I done it, you would've heard about it. Ask Kwok-wah and Gandhi. Darn it. When Kwun died, I was in Macao. Everybody knows! But I bet his kids think I did it. I ain't scared of anything. The eldest son's a doctor. The youngest, a brat. The daughter's married. Only the middle son's running the show. If they go too far, I'll show them. Sorry I failed to protect Uncle Kwun. That's enough, Uncle. Dad used to say, "What goes around comes around." It came later than expected already. Kwok-wah, Man-ching, Blackie and Gandhi. Guess what those four are thinking. Thank you. Thank you all! How's Mom doing, Sis? She's fine. She's sleeping. She told me to bring some smokes to the morgue for Dad. I'll go get them. Hey. Team B, watch Tak Shing Street. Team C, watch the Austin Road exit of that financial building. It has two exits. One on Tak Shing Street, one on Austin... Hello? Something this big, why didn't you call? I called everybody the minute it happened! Kwun's boys can't sit still for sure. The trouble will start tonight. It's the 14th already. The 14th. Time to pay the Ngai family. I'm the youngest here, so let me be the troublemaker. Starting from this month, I'm not paying Kwun anymore. What do you three think? Cheers. - Cheers. - Stop talking nonsense. - Inspector Wong. - What's up? What're your men doing outside Kwok-wah's building? - It's not a good day for chit-chat. - Are you up to something? - Fine. Next time. Okay? - Hey. What's the occasion? Come on. Where's my seat? Only if you're here for the food. All other business has to wait. The food. It's all about the food. It's going to be a big night. Let the Big Four do their thing. We'll deal with the aftermath. Don't let them start fighting or you'll see bodies. What? Not happy? You know the rule. Pick a card to decide who takes command. Okay, highest card wins. Come on! There's nothing more for us to talk about. What's up, Hau? Kwok-wah. I heard you're planning a casino in Macao. I've got the government in my pocket. How about a joint venture? Uncle Kwun's dead. I'm not in the mood. I see. The Macao trip wasn't all business. I know you had fun with Gandhi's wife. Sorry, I can't drop my casino in Macao. I've got to go. What are Sam's people doing? I know Kwok-wah paid up. Don't change the subject. Tell me something I don't know! Call me when you get things straight! Hey, Hau took care of Kwok-wah in ten minutes. The Big Four are having a tough time. Hau took out a million's worth of coke. What? Mafia roadblock or what? Out of my way! - More people will come later. - Stop! I don't know why Kwok-wah paid up, Mr. Ngai. But I won't negotiate. I don't plan to negotiate, either. Pass the phone to Blackie. Hey, Blackie. Don't know why he calls you from my neighborhood. What's up, Hau? I'm with Gandhi all the way. He's not paying, so neither will I. I heard you and Gandhi have been tight. The heroin you two smuggled got stolen. You guys lost millions, right? Luckily, I found the stuff in your warehouse. Want me to hand it to Gandhi now? Hey, what's he talking about? From the Tsim Sha Tsui Big Five, Kwok-wah and Blackie paid up. Including Sam, that's three to two. I'm the youngest here. I've got to pay. See you. Don't think too much. Cheers! Hello? Pay my share for me! Inspector Wong, Mr. Ngai went to eat. A bit late for eating, don't you think? My dad always came here after work. I have to keep up the ritual. Do you want to join us? It's your seat from now on. Must be tough. Not at all. You guys worked all night for nothing. Now, that is tough. Well done, Hau. I hope you can keep it up. Don't let it turn into a tragedy. Let's go. What did you say? We want to celebrate Kwun's death. Time to pop the champagne! Want me to pop one for you? What? Want to mess with cops? Officers! The Ngais are in mourning. What more do you want? Let's go. Sam. Thank you. Dad used to operate street gambling here. It started out as a nickel-and-dime business. Now, who in Tsim Sha Tsui doesn't know his name? "What goes around... comes around," he said. And now he's... I'll always remember this day. Hello? It's all good, honey. Want some snacks? Good to hear that. I'll wait for you at home. 27149. An officer has to have a clean background. Though you cut your ties with the Ngais many years ago, you still share the same father as Wing-hau Ngai. That means you lied on your application. I have to let you go. But before you leave, go see "Mr. Wrong Socks." Still want to be a cop? Can I? Only if you can give me a good reason. I want to be a righteous person. If you want to be a cop, help me. You have no other way. You picked me because I'm Hau's brother, right? When the time comes, will you arrest him yourself? How do I start? Hey! Hey! Beat him up! Beat him up! - Get down. - How are the racing results? - Shut up. - Did you win? Did you? Shut up. You okay? Hang on in there? Hey, what's wrong? Does it still hurt? My dad passed away today. He was so good to me. I asked the officer if I could go to his funeral. The officer said, "Know what it means to be a prisoner? It means you're not even allowed to attend your father's funeral. Don't you know that?" - Get out of here! - Come on. Stop that. TIME Are you nuts? You sent Yan to be a mole? Don't you know Hau is his brother? So what? Bring me his file. So you're playing the boss now, huh? You know that the files are classified. I treat you like a brother, and this is what I get? If you're a real brother, don't ask. It's okay. Calm down. Speak carefully. She had an abortion! It's no big deal. Just a baby. You can always have another one! That's how it works. I've been with you for four years, and I've bailed you out a lot of times. One minute, we're dining with my folks, the next, you are in a gang fight. I don't want our baby to grow up like you. Do you understand? Why so uptight? It's nothing. Uncle says you're doing well. Ever thought about helping the family out? I know you want to keep a distance from the Ngais. But we're blood brothers. It's a fact. Right? It's my daughter's birthday this Sunday. You're invited back home. - You really hate talking to me, huh? - No. Promoted already? Soon you'll be a superintendent. Might as well become a full-time cop. Sam's kidding. Go on, give him a smile. Thanks for your intel these two years. When you were still a rookie, I helped you catch some small potatoes. It's about time you caught some big shots. How about catching me? Why so dirty? - Or you can catch this hot chick. - What're you doing? What a hot booty! Your man must be one good-looking bastard. It's you! Who else? - See you. - You're leaving? I've got to go meet Mr. Ngai. Sam's so good to you. But he's not good to himself. It's been four years. He could be in charge by now. But he's already given everything to the Ngais. Now the Ngai family is all powerful. Hau will take revenge for sure. For the past four years, I haven't been sleeping well. Hello? I'm Inspector Chi-shing Wong. Don't worry, Mary. I won't let anything happen to you. IO0746. Talk is cheap. IO0749. Get them upstairs. I promise. Wow! Hey. Hey. Up into the air! Two days ago, a real estate agent came. Guess how much he offered? 160 million! What's wrong with Hong Kong? Tell me! When my dad bought it, it was 9.28 million. - What a world. - Moving, Mr. Ngai? 1997 is approaching. Time to emigrate. It's no big deal. Communication's easy these days. - We're just a phone call away. - I'm just worried about the phone bill. The phone company's greedy, you know. I've discussed it with Mom. Our businesses is doing well. You guys have helped out for such a long time. I don't want to be ungrateful. I want to split the business up among you guys after I leave. Treat it as a gift or a retirement fund. Let's eat. Whatever you want. We should hang out like this more often. Mr. Ngai. Are you really leaving? After you're gone, all hell will break loose. You're a Buddhist, aren't you, Sam? Easy to start, hard to let go. I'm letting go, so be happy for me. I've thought about it. Cocaine is the future. Those four ship it in small bags from South America. Small-timers. I've closed a deal with the Thais. You'll have the monopoly. You'll be the top dog, the leader of the pack. Go to Thailand and wrap up the logistics. You plan to get rid of those four? Mom. Here, kiss her. Move closer to the right, please. Wing-yan! - Come join the family portrait. - Okay. Stand next to me! Okay. Let's take another photo. One, two, three. One more. I haven't been around much these two years. So this is a rare opportunity, spending time with the whole family. Your siblings are in legit businesses. It's time you helped out the family. Everything that Dad did was for the family. I have done the same. I hope you will, too. A deal's coming up next week. Come with me. I'll call you. APRIL 14 He's taking the deal seriously, so he'll do it himself. It'll take place next Wednesday. The 14th... Kwun's memorial. Hau wants to whack the Big Four. Why did he send Sam away? I don't know. Sam would be useful to him. Unless he wants to kill Sam too. Hey. I've been following you around. I'm your superior, after all. I want to know what your plan is. The Ngais are your family. Do you know what you're doing? Sir. I'm a cop. Good. Give me a salute. I've booked a table. Are you free for dinner? Look good in my cap? Keung. Looking good? What'll you do in Thailand in that outfit? Nothing special. Have some shark fin. A massage. Have a threesome. That's for sure. - Honey. - What? - Why didn't you tell me about your trip? - It's a business trip! Not for fun! Don't worry. I'll behave, okay? Hau plans to whack the four guys. I know. But do you know you're his target too? Nonsense! How can that be? Just wait for me at the airport. Time to board, Sam! HONG KONG KAI TAK AIRPORT That's all I can do for now. Call Sam again when the plane lands. I'm going to kill Hau tonight. Don't do anything rash. I'm not being rash. Four years ago, you told me to kill Kwun. So what? Want to blackmail me now? I'm not blackmailing you. We simply passed the point of no return! I'll send everybody away. Tonight's operation is top secret. We're divided into three teams. Team A watches here. Team B here. Wait for my order before doing anything. Team C follows the target until... Nobody told me about the date change. You know Hau changes his mind all the time. You think Yan's the only mole? My man has been undercover for seven years! Where are the cards? We'll run the show together tonight. Let's go! - Don't move. - Stand still! What is it, Hau? Keeping silent until your lawyer gets here? Come on, cooperate with us! In fact, I appreciate your cooperation. You're speaking so obscurely, Mr. Ngai. I don't get it. Dad used to say, "The way things work in the streets, what goes around always comes around." He died four years ago. It's about time. The stove's hot enough now. She's here, boss. I'm out of here. You're here now. - What can you swing? - Wait and see. Got it, sir! The two foreigners are private eyes. Hello. Honey! - Where are you? - Thailand, of course. Come back right away. - Are you nuts? Why should I come back? - Don't ask questions! Just come back! Hau wants you dead! Nonsense! I'm working for him as we speak! Listen to me. I killed... Kwun. You've got a VCR? Is it good? It's an awesome show! Take care. Run if you have to. What did Hau say? - Sam. - Sunny! Four years ago, you told me to kill Kwun. - So what? Want to blackmail me now? - I'm not blackmailing you. We simply passed the point of no return! I'll send everybody away. I hired Alan and Johnson to investigate my father's murder. Who would've guessed? The police knowingly violated the law and killed my father, a law-abiding citizen. CIP Luk. Isn't that an officer in the video? Whether to nail him or not, that's up to you. What a good show. You're so damn photogenic. Four years ago, how much did Sam's woman pay you? Give me another chance, Mr. Ngai. I gave them a chance four years ago. They didn't take it. If I give you a chance... are you going to take it today? You've been with us for seven years now. You're a cop. We're the bad guys. Time to accept our fates. You can't blame me. Your Inspector Wong killed my dad. Any word from Sam? Sam called me, he said he was fine. He asked you to hide for a few more days and wait for him here. Where are your folks? All emigrated. You didn't want to go? Let's go, Sam! We got rid of the Thais. Let's go! You know you're not going to make it. I know. My girl's in danger in Hong Kong. - Please help me. - Why should I? Because I'll help you whack your boss. I know you want to be in charge. Moreover... I've been treating you as a friend. Don't believe him, Sam! Don't! - Get lost. - Don't believe him! Get lost! Sorry, Sam. Are you here to arrest me? If you're going to kill Hau, then I will arrest you. Then there's nothing to discuss. I spoke with my superiors. They're with you all the way this time. How's that? I conspired to murder! Even the Brits agree that we can't let the triads break us. Listen. The whole department's behind you. Good enough? Where are the cards? The highest card wins. Come back with me to the department. The key! Forget it. I screwed up. No need to drag everyone down. We found this on our first job. You've kept it, I knew that all along. Look. I've let you get your way in the past. It's your turn to listen for once. We're like brothers. I won't just stand by. Law's my snitch in the Ngai family. He hasn't contacted me for days. Neither has Yan. The key. Help! Help! Get some help! I need help. Why did you lie to me? I didn't. Something happened to Sam. I told you I was a simple woman. I have to do something for my husband. I'm going to Thailand. Please don't go! Forget it. You don't have to follow us anymore. I mean, I don't want you to go. You've been with Sam for years. Hasn't it occurred to you... that Sam's dead? What did you say? I can take care of you. - What are you doing? - I don't want you to go. You're out of line! Listen up. I'm your boss' woman. Don't let me see your face again. She will go to the airport tonight. Hello? Hello? I killed Kwun. If a man treats me well, I'll do anything. TIME File number IO3142. About Inspector Wong conspiring in murder. This is the 11th internal hearing, conducted by three senior officers. Inspector Wong, do you have any questions? No. No. On April 11, 1995, the department received this tape accusing you of conspiring in a murder with triad members. I plead guilty, sir. What happened to you? If I told you that the evidence couldn't stand, would you like to start over? I'm sorry. I broke the law. I'm grateful to all of you. But I no longer have any confidence. I lost. What about Luk then? Can you face him if you give up now? Wong, the war's not over. We all want a closure to this incident. The public needs to know Hong Kong isn't run by the Ngai family. Here's a file from Interpol. Read it before making your mind up. Ever been to a funeral in Thailand? A few months ago, I had one for my wife. The monks chanted for three full days. I didn't shed a single tear. On the day of the burial, they left the casket in the living room. I was mad. I wanted to beat them up. The monk told me it's a tradition in Thailand. The deceased... as long as we keep her company for a little while, can attain eternal peace. But I asked the monk, "What if my wife wasn't in the coffin, could she still attain eternal peace?" Sorry about your wife. The monk placed his hand here. He said, "No problem. Your wife's here." And this is exactly... where the Thai guy shot me. So I told myself... I've passed the point of no return. Testifying against Hau in Hong Kong could be dangerous. I believe in you. You're so handsome. Haven't heard that for ages. Thanks. What's your plan? Just trying to do my best. No big deal. Just doing my job. I'll leave Hong Kong when it's all over. See you later. You've changed! You cut something into the coke. Got anything to say? Take it all then. Don't go too far, Yan. It'd break the boys' morale. Mr. Ngai asked me to do this. Don't like it? Drive him to a hospital. No matter what, they're elders after all. You've got lots to learn from them. Uncle will retire in a few years. You know what I mean? I don't need any hiccups now. The Labor Athletic Association has a dinner party... for us Political Consultative candidates. If everything works out, our family will no longer live in shadows. CELEBRATING THE HANDOVER Mr. Zhang. Mr. Ngai. - This is Mr. Zhang. - How are you? When Solicitor Hung mentioned you, I didn't believe him. You're amazingly young, Mr. Ngai. - What's your Zodiac sign? - Ox. The Year of the Ox. Ox is good. Director Chen likes young people. - I'll introduce you later. - Thanks. Really? Director said he hated the triads. That's right, SP Leung. Mr. Ngai's been invited to act as a consultant to the police. Really? Congratulations. - Where do you golf these days? - Zhongshan. Zhongshan? What's your handicap these days? - Hello. - Mr. Kwok. Mr. Wing-hau Ngai. I'm Mr. Ngai's solicitor. Tonight's a celebration for Hong Kong's handover. All other business can wait. What if I say no? Got any problem with that? Mr. Ngai, you're a suspect in several murder cases from 1995. This is your arrest warrant. You're under arrest. Everything you say will be recorded and could be used as evidence against you. Do you have any questions? No. I looked through their files. The murder charges won't stand. But the charge of being a triad boss, that one will stick. Brother, the unions and the political parties called. They want to withdraw their invitations. News from the HK and Macao Affairs Office. They have revoked your candidacy. - Call Beijing. Get some friends to help. - Let me try. Forget it. They even found a dead man to testify against you. Everyone knows how loyal Sam was to you. Now he's the prosecution's witness It's over. Sorry. Can't help you. You said there'd be no problem. Everyone's watching to see how we react. What are you going to do? What can I do? Threaten the government? Don't take it the wrong way. We're all in the same boat. I should be off then. I'm just a lawyer, not one of you. I don't intend to sink with you. Yes. Sam has a wife and a daughter in Thailand. It's your call. Sis. You and the brothers should take Mom to Hawaii for a while. Okay. Okay. Haven't been there for a while. - Are you going to be all right? - I'll be fine. Sorry, I can't help the family. - The key thing is you turn out okay. - Don't be silly. We're a family. Take care of Mom. Don't worry. Leave it to us three. Even with my testimony, Hau will only get a couple of years. It's true. He'll have to whack you to get life. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I have to thank you. Without you, I could never have come back. Save it! I'm busy these days. Anything you need, ask them. They'll protect you. Okay. Sam. Thanks. So, how's it going? Good. I've been transferred to the CIB. I will be Inspector in Training next month. Did Mary call you... before she left? Don't be too hard on yourself, Sam. Inspector Wong said to ask you if I needed anything. Will you really help me? {\an8}KAI-CHEUNG LUK KAI-YIN LAW I thought you wouldn't come. Why's that? So here we are. It's been two years. Because of my father's case, you didn't dare to call me for two years? You couldn't face me? Right. Everything you need to nail Hau is in the safe. I've organized the files by date. Why do you still help me? I'm not helping you. I'm a cop. I want to keep my promise to SP Luk. I don't want to work undercover anymore. Two more years and I'll become the top dog. What for? To end up in prison? Let's bury the past. Just close the case and bring me back into the department. Give me a nice desk. Make sure it has a sea view. And don't let me see your face again. Don't worry, you won't see me anymore. One more thing. I couldn't spell some of the words. Come find me if you don't understand. But don't mess up the order. I worked so hard on that. I'll kill you if you do. That's great. Then I'll owe you nothing. You wish. Thank you, officer. Sam, we've gathered enough info. The trial will start in three days. Mr. Hon. Hello? OCTB. Inspector Wong. Sam's gone. He escaped through the kitchen. Who was guarding the kitchen? Sam made a call to Thailand before he escaped. Hello? Mr. Ngai. What do you want from me? You called me, so tell me how you can help me. Am I right? Sit down. Whack me. Kill me and it's all over. Why should I? I haven't done that kind of stuff for ages. Everything can be negotiated. Hong Kong's big enough for us both. We could even be partners, Sam. Let's forget about the past. You will kill me. You'll kill me tonight But who's going to take care of your family? Just in! Hau has Sam's wife and daughter as hostages. That's his Thai maid. I managed to stay alive all these years. It's all because... I have some good buddies in Thailand. You'll want to take this call. It's from Hawaii. Your whole family's there. My Thai buddies, too. Where's Daddy? Where is he? Mr. Ngai! Shut up. You'll whack me tonight. I told you so. - Police. Freeze! - Get down. Quick! Get down. Freeze! Put it down, Wing-hau Ngai! Don't stop him! He tried to kill me once before. Let him try again! Officers! After he shoots me... it'll be your call to shoot him or not! What goes around... comes around. Two questions. Did you kill his whole family? Of course not. My buddies and I were just scaring him. Did you expect me to kill him? Would you believe me if I said no? I expected to die here. It was my only option. Sorry. Do you know how hard I worked to collect tons of evidence to put him away for life? Who is this? Hello. The Thai guy, Sam. Paul! Thank you. It's all good. We're partners now. Cocaine will go straight to Hong Kong. Should I wrap up the Ngai episode? Paul... maybe we shouldn't go too far. It was pure luck that you bumped into me. Otherwise you would've been killed. We were destined to be partners when my gun failed to kill you. We have to go this far. The handover ceremony of Hong Kong commenced earlier at 11:20. Both countries' anthems were played by the military bands. A British flag rose up in the hall. The ceremony was dignified. Yet it had its share of relaxed moments before its commencement. When both countries' military bands played, {\an8}some Chinese representatives took pictures. {\an8}Prince Charles and Governor Patten were smiling as they entered the venue. The ceremony officially commenced. Three British soldiers and three Chinese soldiers, who were holding the PRC flag, marched slowly onto the podium. The Chinese soldiers displayed the PRC flag. Following their lead, three HK Royal Police officers emerged with three HKSAR Police officers, who were holding the HKSAR flag. The three SAR officers displayed the HKSAR flag to the honorable guests. And now all the guests have risen. It was exactly midnight, the arrival of July 1, 1997. The PRC flag rose with the HKSAR flag, marking the end of the colonial era. It also signified the beginning of the One Country, Two Systems policy. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China has been established. Okay, it's a deal. Come join me. You know what the worst kind of boss is? An ugly boss. Looks are everything! Look how I shine. What's your name, miss? What's your name, miss? I'm... Ma... I'm Ma... Mary. Mary. I'm...
